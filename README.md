# IBM Python for Data Science â€“ Certification 

To be honest, Python always felt a bit confusing when I first started. But with each line of code, I slowly began to connect the dotsâ€”and this course really helped me understand Python from a data science perspective. From working with pandas, numpy, and data visualization to writing cleaner, more efficient codeâ€”this was a great experience!

# ðŸ“˜ Covered Modules:
1. **Basic Python** â€“ Syntax, variables, types, operators, input/output
2. **Python Data Structures** â€“ Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and operations
3. **Python Programming Fundamentals** â€“ Loops, conditions, functions, and logic
4. **Working with Data in Python** â€“ File I/O, reading CSVs, handling datasets
5. **NumPy Arrays & APIs** â€“ Creating and manipulating arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations, NumPy math/statistics functions


I started from the very basics and worked my way through Python fundamentals, data structures, file handling, and NumPy. This helped me understand how real-world data can be handled and processed using code.

 Learned: 
 â€¢ Core Python syntax & logic
â€¢ Data Structures (lists, dicts, tuples)
â€¢ File reading & dataset handling
â€¢ NumPy for data computation & arrays

# Slowly progressing towards my dream â€” thank you IBM!
